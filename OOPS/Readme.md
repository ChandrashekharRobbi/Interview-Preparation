# 1. What is meant by the term OOPs?
OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is the programming paradigm that is defined using objects. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have some characteristics and behaviors.

# 2. What is the need for OOPs?
There are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them are: 

OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they don’t know the actual implementation.
With OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.
Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.

# 3. What are some major Object Oriented Programming languages?
The programming languages that use and follow the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm or OOPs, are known as Object-Oriented Programming languages. Some of the major Object-Oriented Programming languages include:

Java
C++
Javascript
Python
PHP
And many more.

# 4. What are some other programming paradigms other than OOPs?
Programming paradigms refers to the method of classification of programming languages based on their features. There are mainly two types of Programming Paradigms:

Imperative Programming Paradigm
Declarative Programming Paradigm

# 5. What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is also a part of the OOPs concept. It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It also helps to restrict any direct access to some of an object’s components.

# 6. What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is an OOPs concept to build the structure of real-world objects. It “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information from the outside. The main focus of abstraction is to hide unnecessary details from the users. It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.

# 7. What is method overloading?
There is a concept where two or more methods can have the same name. But they should have different parameters, different numbers of parameters, different types, or both. These methods are known as overloaded methods and this feature is called method overloading. 

# 8. What is method overriding?
Method overriding is a concept of object-oriented programming.

It is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method which is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.

# 9. Types of Inheritance in OOPS
Different types of inheritances in OOps are as follows:

Single Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance
Multi-level Inheritance
Multi-path Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance
types of inheritance
# 10. What are the main features of OOPs?
The main features of OOPs are given as follows:

In OOP, you combine the code into one unit so you can specify the parameters of each piece of data. This process of wrapping up data into a single unit is called encapsulation. 
By using classes, you can generalise your object types and make your application easier to use. This is termed as an abstraction.
The ability for a class to inherit characteristics and behaviours from another class allows for more code reuse.
Polymorphism allows for the creation of several objects from a single, adaptable class of code.
# 11. Is it possible to call the base class method without creating an instance?
Yes, we can possibly call the base class method without creating an instance in the following 3 cases:

If the method is static
Calling the inherited method inside a derived class
Calling the method using the base keyword from the sub-classes
The most popular case is that of the static methods.
